# GALARIO-Tools
Useful scripts for using [GALARIO](https://github.com/mtazzari/galario) (Gpu Accelerated Library for Analysing Radio Interferometer Observations).

Note: these codes are meant to run with a GPU. If you want to use the CPU version, just change "import galario.double_cuda as g_double" to "import galario.double as g_double"
